1a. The option becomes worthless if B is ever higher than the stock price, so B needs to be greater than the starting stock price and k.
It needs to be larger than S0 because if it wasn't, the option would become worthless as soon as it began.
It needs to be larger than K because since the call payoff is MAX(S-K, 0), if K is greater than B (and therefore greater than the stock price, 
since the stock price cannot be greater than B) the option will always be worth 0 so it will never be worth buying.
